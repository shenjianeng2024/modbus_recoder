# Task 010 Analysis: 测试框架和质量保证

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Rust Backend Testing
**Agent Type**: rust-axum-backend-expert
**Files**:
- `src-tauri/tests/` directory structure
- `src-tauri/tests/common/mod.rs`
- `src-tauri/tests/modbus_tests.rs`
- `src-tauri/benches/` for performance tests

**Work**:
- Set up Rust testing framework with test environment
- Create mock Modbus server for testing
- Write unit tests for all Rust modules
- Add integration tests for Tauri commands
- Set up performance benchmarks

### Stream B: Frontend Testing Framework
**Agent Type**: frontend-architect
**Files**:
- `src/test-utils.tsx`
- `src/components/__tests__/` directories
- `src/hooks/__tests__/` directories
- Jest/Vitest configuration files

**Work**:
- Configure React Testing Library + Jest/Vitest
- Create test utilities and mocks for Tauri APIs
- Write component tests for all UI components
- Add hook testing with proper mocking
- Set up test coverage reporting

### Stream C: E2E and CI/CD Integration
**Agent Type**: quality-engineer
**Files**:
- `e2e/` directory with Playwright tests
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `playwright.config.ts`
- Quality gates configuration

**Work**:
- Set up Playwright for E2E testing
- Create CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Configure quality gates (coverage, performance)
- Add cross-platform testing workflow
- Set up test reporting and artifacts

## Dependencies
- Requires basic project structure (Task 002)
- Should be established early for parallel development

## Success Criteria
- [x] >90% code coverage for backend Rust code
- [x] Comprehensive frontend component and hook tests
- [x] E2E tests covering main user journeys
- [x] Automated CI/CD testing on all platforms
- [x] Performance benchmarks established

## Estimated Effort
- **Total**: 12-16 hours
- **Stream A**: 5-6 hours
- **Stream B**: 4-5 hours
- **Stream C**: 3-5 hours
